    ee - Emacs information manager

DESCRIPTION
===========

    Ee is the categorizing information manager for Emacs.
    It works by collecting information from different
    sources and converting information to a relational or
    associative database.  It uses the fields of database
    table records to build the category trees, which are
    displayed in the Emacs view buffer.  The rules for
    creating the views are also specified by similar data
    structures and include the rules for building category
    paths, sorting records and categories, calculating
    the totals of category fields, filtering records, and
    printing category tree and record lines.

INSTALLATION
============

    1. Download the latest version from:

       http://www.jurta.org/emacs/ee/

    2. Unpack the emacs-ee archive, e.g.:

       tar zxvf emacs-ee-version.numbers.tar.gz

    3. Add next lines to your .emacs or site-start.el file:

       (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs/ee/")
       (require 'ee-autoloads)

       where "~/emacs/ee/" is the directory where you installed *.el files.
